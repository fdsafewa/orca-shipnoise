# shipnoise.net

This repo specifies the web backend and frontend for the Ship Noise web application -- a new way to visualize and understand the underwater noise generated by ships in the Salish Sea. The goal of the app is to reduce noise for the endangered Southern Resident killer whales and other marine life. The open source prototype designed and built during the Dec 2020 Amazon hackathon will be improved iteratively through a user-centered design process. In it's early stages, shipnoise will leverage the same Orcasound hydrophones used to listen for orcas (see [orcasound.net](https://orcasound.net)).

## How it works

At this stage, this repo is merely a prototype for the real shipnoise.net -- a proof-of-concept for future development. 
It is automatically deployed to the AWS Amplify environment from this repo's main branch. Pushes to the main branch trigger a new deployment.

The demo site is available at: https://main.d27wklsx9a9q36.amplifyapp.com/ 
The web application will eventually be deployed at [shipnoise.net](https://shipnoise.net)

## Architecture

We are using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), which is a suite of tools and services that is used to build full-stack applications. 
Here is a basic description of the architecture:

- The frontend is built using React
- We use the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API, which leverages AWS AppSync and is backed by DynamoDB
- The ShipNoise data will be stored in [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

Note: At this stage of development, the shipnoise data processing is still not connected to DynamoDB. As of this writing, this app is mostly just a skeleton full-stack application with dummy data to provide a proof-of-concept for future development. In the future we will be pushing the real hydrophone and AIS data to DynamoDB for retrieval by the site.

## Running the code locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
